# MasteryLoL

This project is a work in progress and is not yet complete nore ready for deployment. However, this repo is available
to allow others to look at it. You can check back here for when it is finally released.

The github will have a release tag when the site is published in its Alpha state.

This project will be Open-sourced sometime between the Alpha and Release versions.

## Overview
Mastery LoL is a tool that allows league of legends players to achieve their mastery goals!
With a way to track all of your champion mastery levels, points to next level and other information,
MasteryLoL is a one-stop-shop for all of your mastery needs.

MasteryLoL consists of two, main components:
1. A website to view your journey
2. A discord bot to add to your server for you and all of your friends

### The Website
The website not only allows you to view all of your mastery information BUT it
will also allow you to track your performance on each champion as well as your account
in general over the course of your mastery journey!

The specific stats we want to track are unknown as of right now however this will be
fleshed out to a significant extent prior to beta release.

### The Discord Bot
Provides a general overview of mastery on the champions you are playing as well as how your
mastery journey is going.

## General Roadmap
